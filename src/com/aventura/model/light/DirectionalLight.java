 * Directional Light also known as an infinite light source, radiates light in a single direction
 * from infinitely far away e.g. sun, whose rays can be considered parallel.
 * Since they have no position in space, directional directional have infinite range and the intensity
 * of light they radiate does not diminish over distance.
